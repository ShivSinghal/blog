# PyData NYC


I really messed up my talk; I kinda feel it should not even go live, that's the last thing I want my parents/friends or me to see.
I think I am bad at calculating situations, I really need to fix it, I don't want to feel like this again.
I wish I could go back in time and change stuff, but I can't, so all I can do now is make the future better
and make things work.

1. Learn to priortise tasks/role/thing in life.
2. Practice stuff 20X.
3. Blog more about topic before giving a talk on it, it helps you revise stuff.
4. Be respectful with time.



People to thanks:
- James Powell

Take more notes

What I felt?
It felt as If I can't give a talk anymore, or it will take me time to get started again, because I fell from a pretty high groud.
I even called a person by wrong name, I thought it was peter wang, it's so stupid of me, now I don't feel like to be here, I kinda feel I don't deserve it.
I should have realy taken it seriously, it's all my fault :/
sometimes, expecting a over performance is bad, atleast when giving a talk

I will probably tweet about my learning of giving a hands on talk.

- if you feel you need more time to delever a talk of hight scale I will suggest that you don't do it








Some notes to self
- Read more, like read every day, read as much as you can! nothing else can help you.
- Improve your skills as much as you can.
