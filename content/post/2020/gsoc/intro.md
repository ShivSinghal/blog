<p style="text-align: justify;">
On May 4th, 2020, I was trying to focus on my to-do-list for the day while desperately trying not to think
about the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> result. Remembering how the last two times I applied, and it didn’t
go down well, it unnerved me a little; preparing me better for this year’s results.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
On one hand, I was frantically refreshing the page, and on the other, I was also exploring something new to
pursue and deviate my attention. Calming my breath and taking one step at a time, I let the feeling sink that
this year is my last chance to apply for it. And trust me when I say I <i>really</i> wanted to work on this project
with my mentor!
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Somewhere around 11:35 PM, about 5 minutes after the result was announced, I decided to refresh the
page and see what my fate had in store for me. Feeling exhilarated, I also noticed a tinge of nervousness in
my heartbeat. This inner wiring in me completely bewildered, telling me how there is a chance you won’t get
in, but the subconscious was also glad that I tried and tried relentlessly. I braced myself for the result…
eyeing the webpage. And I see something that I am not prepared for.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
I see my project is <i>listed!</i> No, it isn’t possible, really? -- I hit the refresh button again, and the project was still
there. And in that moment, I just knew the summer of 2020 is going to be all about open-source!
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">
My project is lined up with <a href="https://nteract.io/">nteract</a>, an open-source organisation responsible for some of the coolest and
most used tools in data science such as <a href="https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen">Hydrogen</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/papermill/">papermill</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases/latest">nteract Desktop</a>. It is also fiscally sponsored by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.
The objective of my work will be to further help in introducing <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4917324802424832">reproducible computing</a> to <a href="https://play.nteract.io/">nteract play</a>. From
my 2 months of experience of working with the nteract community, I think there are so many talented
people involved with the projects. I absolutely <i>love</i> this community.
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">
Even though I was looking forward to cracking the opportunity for a lot of reasons but mainly because of
the mentorship provided at GSoC. I have a tendency to value any advice I get, it means something to me. I
was feeling just a wee bit proud and enthralled because well, I get to work under the leadership of <a href="https://twitter.com/captainsafia">@captiansafia</a>, my mentor. She looks after the organisation and maintains the nteract ecosystem along with working at Microsoft.
</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">
You know I’ll suggest something! -- You can come on my journey with me and stay updated with my work in
GSoC, just follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ramantehlan">@ramantehlan</a>, or you are always welcome to come back here! As a part of
my work, from June 1st till August 31st, I will write weekly or biweekly blog posts about my progress. I will
link all my related posts for you all to read right here! Go on, brace yourself for some more as you scroll!
