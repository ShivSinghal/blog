In my last blog, I talked about two main tasks:

1. Developing the project using a blueprint created in Figma. 
2. Integrating Github API in nteract play. 

<p style="text-align: justify;">
After 1st evaluation, letâ€™s look at how far along we are with the project.
</p>


## UI/UX Integration

- [x] Layout
- [x] BinderMenu
- [x] Input
- [x] Menu
- [x] Button 
- [x] Avatar
- [x] Dialog
- [x] Landing Page
- [x] Auth page
- [x] Editor 
- [x] Console 
- [ ] Notification 
- [ ] Notebook rendering.
- [ ] FileExplorer 

## Github Integration

- [x] Complete authentication
- [x] Fetch user's public info
- [x] Fetch public files and folders 
- [x] List and create a fork for repo
- [ ] Save back changes to the repo or the fork 

## MyBinder Integration

- [ ] Launch MyBinder instance on start
- [ ] Communicate with JupyterServer.
- [ ] Connect iterm.js to MyBinder instance
- [ ] Execute the command on MyBinder instance

</p>

## Conclusion

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am glad that I passed my 1st evaluation, and I get to continue to work on the project and complete the rest of the tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
The focus for the 2nd evaluation will be on implementing the notebook, saving the changes to Github and making the FileExplorer work</b>.  Safia and I feel this PR is too big, so all the pending tasks after 2nd evaluation will be done in a new PR.
