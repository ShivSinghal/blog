Data is growing at astonishing rates, it is being created every second. [In 2020, every person will generate 1.7 megabytes every second](https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-6). This data is powerful, it helps in making data-informed decisions. For example, [Netflix saves $1 billion per year on customer retention](https://insidebigdata.com/2018/01/20/netflix-uses-big-data-drive-success/), they use data to create its strategy to lower subscription cancellation rates by adjusting or adding new features.

Data generated is most often in a very raw format and it's very hard to make sense of it. Which is why we need to process it to get more sophisticated information out of it. **Data Mining is the process of extracting information from a large amount of data**. Given data of ample size and quality, data mining provides the following capabilities:

- **Predictive**: Predict trends and behaviours.
- **Desciptive**: Discover unknown patterns.

# Tasks

The data mining process involves 6 common classes of tasks:

1. Anomaly Detection
2. Association Rule Learning
3. Clustering
4. Classification
5. Regression
6. Summarization

## 1. Anomaly Detection

The **process to recognize unusual data records, that might be an outlier/change/deviation/noise/error** that requires further examination. This process is also used in a variety of domains, such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection, system health monitoring, event detection in sensor networks and detecting ecosystem disturbances.

## 2. Association Rule Learning
