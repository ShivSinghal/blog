Welcome to my tiny space on the internet, here I share about my work, life and everything in between. If you are just interested in my career, feel free go directly to my <a href="/">website</a>, to know me more personally you can continue reading my blog.

I'm Raman Tehlan, I was first introduced to programming at the age of 11. The first language I used was BASIC, I used it for calculation and to solve simple math problems. By the age of 14, I was comfortable in programming in multiple languages, like C++, BASIC, PHP, JavaScript etc. At 17, I started my first company (AlvisAi) and at 19, I started my second company (Cashfog), both are open-source now. I love to attend hackathons and startup weekends and create new projects. Most of my projects are open source since I am also a FOSS enthusiast, I have contributed to many projects. Right now, I am learning new stuff, also looking for new opportunities to apply them in the real world.

I see my life as a tool to improve the lives of souls around me, trying to leave something behind. I use technology as my power to achieve that.


Regards<br>
**Raman Tehlan**
